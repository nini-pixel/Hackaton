**The Need for Advisory in Decentralized Finance**

Did you know that in 2016 China released the first nationalized digital currency, the digital Yuan? As speculations rise in the financial industry regarding Bitcoin, its expansion threatens to collapse the commercial banking system as we know it. Imagine this, no more errands at HSBC after work or school and no more fees and charges on your over-the-counter transactions! Digital banks would be backed by central banks which would allow them both the advantages of cryptocurrencies and of mobile banking payments. At PMA.inc, our team decided to address a major setback in this scenario: who would advise us, common citizens, on how to manage our money?

This is why we created a prototype in anticipation of the lack of personalized financial advisory in the latter scenario, where robots and AI would become the norm in managing our bank accounts.

Our program identifies top-performing U.S. equity stocks and indexes to tailor the best portfolio for each client based on their industry preferences and available funds. This prototype was tested on historical datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness. However, our long-term vision is to leverage cutting-edge technology to expand our algorithm for future-oriented portfolio growth and prediction. In particular, our project accounts for individual stock risk, such as systematic and inflationary risk, using Consumer Price Index data and beta measurements. It also computes liquidity risks and compares them to our clientâ€™s risk tolerance to craft a portfolio that optimizes their risk exposure. At our firm, we work for our clients and aim to deliver seamless portfolio management support while minimizing customer costs.
